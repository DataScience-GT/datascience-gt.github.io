                    As a nonprofit, we rely on donations to keep us running.
                    Right now, we're an all-volunteer staff but we have
                    operational costs just like any company. Your donation will
                    go towards helping expand our operations, increasing the
                    quality of our materials, and allowing our staff to keep
                    doing their job. Any donation, big or small, is an
                    incredible help.

                    If you want to help bring the resources DSI has to offer to
                    your community, consider starting a chapter! If you do start
                    a chapter, you'll gain access to our bootcamp material,
                    logistics expertise, funding, and sponsors. We'll help you
                    set up a club that creates lasting value for your community
                    â€“ all you have to do is ask! Although new chapters are
                    currently invitation-only, we'll be opening applications for
                    new chapters online by January 2022. In the meantime, you
                    can email us to let us know you're interested.
