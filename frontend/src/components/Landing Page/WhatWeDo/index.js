                  We teach our members core data science skills through a
                  bootcamp that takes our members on a start-to-finish journey,
                  touching on essentials such as cleaning data and identifying
                  biases to more advanced concepts, such as dimensionality
                  reduction and machine learning â€“ all in a digestible,
                  applicable, and interactive format. Members come out of our
                  bootcamp with a polished data science project and the
                  confidence to learn more.

                  through bootcamps tailored to specific concentrations of
                  learning. Data Science is more than just programming; we're
                  equipping our members to apply their skills in the fields of
                  Healthcare, Finance, Data Engineering, Data Visualization, &
